## Executive Summary
For this project, we will look at Covid-19 data in the United States, both live and historical, to assess the effectiveness of governmental policies. Our data visualization and analysis will allow us to provide reflections on the use of data analytics in the process of tackling this challenge, as well as recommendations for future steps in preventing deaths.
